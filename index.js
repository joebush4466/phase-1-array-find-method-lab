//Write a function called superbowlWin() in index.js:

//The function should receive 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects
// Each object has two properties: year and result
// It should use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!
// It should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!)
// If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined


function superbowlWin(array){
    
 for (let item of array){
    if (item.result === "W"){
        return item.year;
        console.log(item.year)
    }
 }
}
